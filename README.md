# Simulation-of-Gibson-et-al-Paper
The files in this repository are the codes I wrote in 2016 to simulate the Direct and First Reaction Method mentioned in Gibson et al (2000).  
(Gibson, M.A. and Bruck, J., 2000. Efficient exact stochastic simulation of chemical systems with many species and many channels. 
The journal of physical chemistry A, 104(9), pp.1876-1889). 

The codes here simulated the stochastic dynamics of a complex chemical reaction system and were written in Python 3.
